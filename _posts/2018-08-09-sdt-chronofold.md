Self Determination Theory posits that in order to achieve intrinsic motivation, a behaviour must fulfil three main needs.

- Autonomy: The feeling of being able to do what you want.
- Competence: The feeling of being good at doing something.
- Relatedness: The feeling of belonging to our environment.

I would like to tell you about how we can apply SDT to look at Games.
My research is about how we can use SDT to create better experiences. Most people would agree that playing is an activity that they would perform willingly. It is a paradox to be forced to have fun. If you have been, then what you were having was most certainly not fun.

###### How can we apply these needs to games?

Lets take Football (or any sport) for instance. (Autonomy) A person who enjoys football is usually willingly playing by their own volition. (Competence) They have the ability to perform, whether it be just adequately or professionally, and they are feel a sense of belonging (Relatedness) amongst their teammates, club, and sportsmen.

What about Chess?

When these three needs are fulfilled, a person feels driven to perform more of that behaviour.
I would like to tell you about how we can use these three needs to look at player motivation in games and how we applied it to our own game.
