Section 1. Your research, including games, and literature (7 - 15 pages)

Section 2. Your methodology for testing your game. I’d suggest the approach we’ve covered in class, the Iterative Approach in Games, Design and Play but of course others are welcome. A mixed methods approach is also fine or an Action Approach (Norman) was also covered. (1 - 2 pages)

Section 3. Your work and your iterations of it. Why did you make the choices you made? How does your user testing support or change this? (10 - 15 pages)

Section 4. Next steps and future directions for the project. (1 - 5 pages pages)
