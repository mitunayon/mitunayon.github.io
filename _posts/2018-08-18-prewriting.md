Section 1. Your research, including games, and literature (7 - 15 pages)

Section 2. Your methodology for testing your game. I’d suggest the approach we’ve covered in class, the Iterative Approach in Games, Design and Play but of course others are welcome. A mixed methods approach is also fine or an Action Approach (Norman) was also covered. (1 - 2 pages)

Section 3. Your work and your iterations of it. Why did you make the choices you made? How does your user testing support or change this? (10 - 15 pages)

Section 4. Next steps and future directions for the project. (1 - 5 pages pages)


#### First draft (10,000 - 12,000 words) 11k words / 25pgs.. around 440 words per page.

Abstract: Brief description of SDT. Establish Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Establish SDT Needs. How can games be viewed from an SDT lens. Specifically, how the three SDT needs be used to analyse game experiences. The use of rewards in games on player motivation, specifically how it relates to extrinsic motivation.

### Section 1. RESEARCH 7-15 Pages ~4k words

Research on motivation. *why do we do anything? (in a general context)*

Humans are driven by motivation. Our society is built upon rules and regulations that impact our decisions. We work to get paid, we study to pass exams and we instagram our meals for a sense of greater belonging. Yet, do all these things bring us genuine happiness? Self Determination Theory is an approach to looking at human motivation that focuses on personal development and behavioural regulation. (Ryan & Deci 1985)

- Self Determination theory
  - Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
    -
  - The three psychological Needs
    - Autonomy
    - Competence
    - Relatedness
- Behaviourism (an opposite take)
  - Operant conditioning, Skinner Boxes.
    - Reinforcement Schedules.
- The idea that we play for emotion. (Tynan - Designing Games)
  - The change of human values

*How can we encourage people to play*
- How can we satisfy the three needs of SDT through game design?
  - Autonomy (Agency and volition)
    - Providing Agency
      - The illusion of player choice

  - **Competence** (Skill, Flow and Challenge)
    - Designing mechanics that are inherently fun and that encourage learning and growth.
      - What are inherent mechanics?
    - Single Player games
    - Multiplayer games
    - Cooperative games
    - The issue of luck
    - The affects of artificial and inherent Skill
    - Challenge and flow.
      - How to design for learning and development.
  - Relatedness (Social Design, Immersion)
    - The change of human values _(Designing Games)_
    - Immersion
      - The player and the avatar.
      - Interface
        - The affects of Intuitive controls

*Conclusion*
My hypothesis. In order to achieve

### Section 2 methodology for testing my game. (1-2 pgs) ~1k words
Iterative Approach, playtesting and incorporating user feedback in iterative development cycles.

what questions did I use to look for the SDT needs ?
### Section 3 My work and my iterations of it. (10-15 pgs) ~4k words
I assume this is asking what did I contribute to the project?
Explain the reasoning behind decisions. How did user testing support them?

## Section 4 Future directions for the project. (1-5 pgs) ~1k words
continued development
