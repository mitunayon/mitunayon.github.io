title: "Reinforcement Schedules in Games"
---

Rewards can be offered in order to elicit behaviour. It is common in games to offer points, currency, progression or any other desirable to elicit behaviour out of players. This form of conditioning is not so different from laboratory experiments used to study animal behaviour. In these experiments, animals such as pigeons or rats were trained to perform a specific behaviour in return for a reward. These experiments are most commonly known as skinner boxes.

Skinner boxes can be found everywhere in games. These games offer rewards to players for certain behaviour. What is interesting, is that most of the time the behaviour the players are conditioned to perform is not that stimulating or exciting on its own. For instance, in idle clicker games, players are conditioned to perform a menial action such as clicking, in return for points which are spent to increase the ability at which points are gained. This cyclical behaviour is enough to keep players engaged for hours and even weeks.

 In order to reinforce a behaviour, rewards can be offered on a scheduled basis. There are multiple types of reinforcement schedules.

 - Distributing a reward for every X amount of actions.
 - Distributing a reward once for every X interval.
 - Continuous reinforcement. Where a behaviour is always rewarded.
 - 1. Ratio schedules.
   - Fixed Ratio
   - Variable Ratio
     - a percentage chance to occur. Most commonly observed in lootboxes, RPG drops and
     - Guaranteed every X amount of actions
