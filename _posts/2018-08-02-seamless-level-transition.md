How to make a seamless level transition in Unity.

We are trying to make the scene transitions between the main hub and the puzzles as seamless as we can.

A lot of feedback from the previous build of the game mentioned the abrupt scene changing.

Ideas

- Walk into elevator which closes and opens again in the new scene.
- Fade in an out when loading a level.


## notes

- level loads, the departing elevator loads into the new scene. player is unparented from the elevator.
