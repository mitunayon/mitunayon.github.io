How to make a seamless level transition in Unity.

We are trying to make the scene transitions between the main hub and the puzzles as seamless as we can.

A lot of feedback from the previous build of the game mentioned the abrupt scene changing.

Ideas

- Walk into elevator which closes and opens again in the new scene.
- Fade in an out when loading a level.


##### notes

- level loads, the departing elevator loads into the new scene. player is unparented from the elevator.

##### things achieved
- Elevator will not destroy itself upon a new scene load.
- DontDestroyOnLoad elevators will position themselves at the designated elevator entry points.
  - the transform.position of these copied elevators will be matched with the transform.position of the elevator entry object.
  - *TODO* Need to fix the way rotation is brought over from the previous scene. It seems to be an issue with the mouselook rotation.
- *BUG* HeavyDoors stay open once triggered open. Removing its power does not return it back to its original state.
  - I have no idea why this could be.
